                  Insurance brokers may take a percentage of a policy premium as commission, while a mortgage broker can claim a valuation fee to check if a property is worth the amount the client wants to borrow. And in the case of trading, traders also have to pay to use certain services.
               </div>

               <p>
                  However, not all brokers will demand the same fees. That’s why it’s crucial you understand and compare costs to make sure you’re not denting your returns by paying more than you need to.

                  Brokerage fees in brief
               </h1>

               <p>
                  Brokers charge for effectively acting as your middleman when you trade. These vary from broker to broker and also depend on the market you’re trading.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Although these costs were pretty expensive back when the technology and market access weren’t so great, the digital revolution of the industry now means brokerage fees are very competitive.
               </p>
               
               <p>
                  Many of these charges are entirely transparent and fair but some brokers will significantly widen the costs to trade to cover other services they offer — often things customers would never expect to have a price tag. As they won’t charge you directly for these individual features, you could be unwittingly paying over the odds for services you don’t use, and maybe don’t even understand.

         <h1>Brokers can (and will) trade against you</h1>
         <p class="pt-4">
            There always needs to be a buyer and a seller for a trade to take place. And as it’s not possible for a broker to send every trade they receive to the underlying market, they may take the opposite side of your trade instead. This means they lose if you win, but also means they could profit from your losses.
         </p>
         <p class="pt-4">
            However, as brokers have thousands of clients placing trades all day, it’s more likely that your trade will be matched with another trader who has a different view to you. Or if a broker receives a stream of orders in one direction, they may offset their risk by going to the underlying market and placing the same buy or sell trade. Someone else in the world will counteract it, and one party will win while the other loses.
         </p>
         <p class="pt-4">
            In all circumstances, the most important thing is that everyone plays by the same rules. This is why it’s essential that you research the broker you want to use and make sure they have high-quality regulation, are committed to treating clients fairly, and are transparent with their charges and practices.
