                <p>
                    The shares of companies that make up an index sometimes pay dividends. When this happens, the overall value of the index is affected, which can cause the price to fall. <br><br>

                    All figures in the table below represent the estimated reduction in the price of an index given dividends that week. <br><br>

                    Please be aware that the announcement of these dividend adjustments are scheduled events, and leveraged index traders canâ€™t profit or lose from these price movements. <br>
